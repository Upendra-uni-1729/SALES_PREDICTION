# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict future sales for a given dataset using various machine learning models. The goal is to analyze historical sales data, identify key trends and patterns, and build a predictive model that can forecast sales for upcoming periods. The model is designed to assist businesses in making data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we employ a range of machine learning techniques to predict sales based on various features such as past sales data, product attributes, and other relevant factors. The project follows the standard data science workflow, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features that contribute to sales prediction.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating multiple algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

### Models Used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Key Insights:
- Predicting sales based on historical data can significantly improve forecasting accuracy.
- Some features have a high correlation with sales and can drive more accurate predictions.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-Learn (for model building and evaluation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for development and documentation)
